                     <p><span>answers:-</span>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

                        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted
                        programming language primarily used for building interactive web applications.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily
                        used for building interactive web applications. Its key features include:
                        Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs on the client's browser, allowing for dynamic interaction
                        with web pages.
                        Lightweight and versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple DOM
                        manipulation to complex web application development.
                        Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including
                        encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                        Asynchronous programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous operations through callbacks,
                        promises, and async/await syntax, enabling non-blocking I/O operations.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>In JavaScript, "undefined" means a variable has been declared but has not
                        been assigned a value. It's a primitive data type. On the other hand, "null" is an assignment
                        value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's also a primitive data
                        type, but explicitly indicates a lack of value.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What is hoisting in JavaScript?</h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function
                        declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This
                        means you can access variables and functions before they are declared. However, only the
                        declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing)
                        function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. They encapsulate and
                        preserve the state of a function's lexical environment. Here's an example:
                        function outerFunction() {
                        let outerVariable = 'I am outer';
                        function innerFunction() {
                        console.log(outerVariable);
                        }
                        return innerFunction;
                        }
                        let closureExample = outerFunction();
                        closureExample(); // Output: I am outer

                        JavaScript?
                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> In JavaScript, "==" is the equality operator, which checks if two values
                        are equal after performing type coercion if necessary. "===" is the strict equality operator,
                        which checks if two values are equal without performing type coercion. Using "===" is generally
                        preferred because it avoids unexpected type conversions.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> In JavaScript, you can define variables using the var, let, or const
                        keywords. var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. let and const are
                        block-scoped; let variables can be reassigned, while const variables cannot be reassigned once
                        declared.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an
                        asynchronous operation. They allow for chaining asynchronous operations and handling success and
                        error cases. Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, allowing for
                        asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-like manner. It makes asynchronous code easier
                        to read and write by using the async and await keywords.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Higher-order functions are functions that either take other functions as
                        arguments or return functions as results. They enable functional programming paradigms such as
                        map, filter, reduce, and compose. Higher-order functions promote code reusability, modularity,
                        and the creation of expressive and concise code.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>In JavaScript, the value of the this keyword is determined by how a
                        function is called, not where it's defined. It refers to the object that is executing the
                        current function. The value of this can be influenced by function invocation patterns such as
                        method invocation, function invocation, constructor invocation, or using the call, apply, or
                        bind methods.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>JavaScript has several data types, including:
                        Primitive types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol (added in ECMAScript 6).
                        Object types: object, array, function, date, regexp, and more.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that can be invoked
                        with specific arguments. They can be defined using the function keyword or arrow function syntax
                        (() => { }). Functions can accept parameters and return values, making them versatile tools for
                        organizing and executing code logic.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
                        structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects, where each object represents a part of the
                        document, such as elements, attributes, and text nodes. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to
                        dynamically update or modify the content, structure, and style of web pages.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Conditional statements, such as if, else if, and else, allow you to
                        execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. JavaScript evaluates the
                        condition provided in the if statement, and if it's true, the corresponding block of code is
                        executed. If the condition is false, JavaScript moves to the next else if or else statement, if
                        present.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>call method:
                        The call method is used to invoke a function and specify the value of this explicitly. It
                        accepts the context object as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments to be
                        passed to the function. Here's an example:
                        const obj = {
                        name: 'John'
                        };

                        function greet(message) {
                        console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
                        }

                        greet.call(obj, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello, John!
                        apply method:
                        Similar to call, the apply method is used to invoke a function and specify the value of this.
                        However, it accepts an array or array-like object as its second argument, which is passed as
                        individual arguments to the function. Here's an example:
                        const obj = {
                        name: 'Alice'
                        };

                        function greet(message, punctuation) {
                        console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
                        }

                        greet.apply(obj, ['Hi', '!']); // Output: Hi, Alice!
                        bind method:
                        The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified context (the value of this)
                        without invoking it immediately. It returns a new function with the bound context, which can be
                        called later. Here's an example:
                        const obj = {
                        name: 'Emily'
                        };

                        function greet(message) {
                        console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
                        }

                        const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj);
                        boundGreet('Hey'); // Output: Hey, Emily!
                        Additionally, bind can also partially apply arguments to a function:
                        const obj = {

                        executed. In javascript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an
                        argument of another function, can be returned by another function, and can be used as a property
                        of an object.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Syntax error: Syntax errors are mistakes or spelling problems in the code
                        that cause the program to not execute at all or to stop running halfway through. Error messages
                        are usually supplied as well.
                        Logical error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic or program is
                        incorrect. The application executes without problems in this case. However, the output findings
                        are inaccurate. These are sometimes more difficult to correct than syntax issues since these
                        applications do not display error signals for logic faults.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What are arrow functions?</h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They
                        provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be
                        used as a function expression.
                        Let’s compare the normal function declaration and the arrow function declaration in detail:
                        // Traditional Function Expression
                        var add = function(a,b){
                        return a + b;
                        }

                        // Arrow Function Expression
                        var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b;
                        Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. If there is only one returning
                        expression then we don’t need to use the return keyword as well in an arrow function as shown in
                        the example above. Also, for functions having just one line of code, curly braces { } can be
                        omitted.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Both rest parameter and spread operator were introduced in the ES6 version
                        of javascript.

                        Rest parameter ( … ):

                        It provides an improved way of handling the parameters of a function.
                        Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take a variable number of
                        arguments.
                        Any number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest parameter.
                        It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the arguments.
                        Rest parameters can be used by applying three dots (...) before the parameters.
                        function extractingArgs(...args){
                        return args[1];
                        }

                        // extractingArgs(8,9,1); // Returns 9

                        function addAllArgs(...args){
                        let sumOfArgs = 0;
                        let i = 0;
                        while(i < args.length){ sumOfArgs +=args[i]; i++; } return sumOfArgs; } addAllArgs(6, 5, 7, 99);
                           // Returns 117 addAllArgs(1, 3, 4); // Returns 8 Spread operator (…): Although the syntax of
                           the spread operator is exactly the same as the rest parameter, the spread operator is used to
                           spreading an array, and object literals. We also use spread operators where one or more
                           arguments are expected in a function call. function addFourNumbers(num1,num2,num3,num4){
                           return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4; } let fourNumbers=[5, 6, 7, 8];
                           addFourNumbers(...fourNumbers); // Spreads [5,6,7,8] as 5,6,7,8 let array1=[3, 4, 5, 6]; let
                           clonedArray1=[...array1]; // Spreads the array into 3,4,5,6 console.log(clonedArray1); //
                           Outputs [3,4,5,6] let obj1={x:'Hello', y:'Bye'}; let clonedObj1={...obj1}; // Spreads and
                           clones obj1 console.log(obj1); let obj2={z:'Yes', a:'No'}; let mergedObj={...obj1, ...obj2};
                           // Spreads both the objects and merges it console.log(mergedObj); // Outputs {x:'Hello',
                           y:'Bye',z:'Yes',a:'No'}; Key differences between rest parameter and spread operator: Rest
                           parameter is used to take a variable number of arguments and turns them into an array while
                           the spread operator takes an array or an object and spreads it Rest parameter is used in
                           function declaration whereas the spread operator is used in function calls. </p>

                        changes continue outside of it. It appears to be pass by reference in this case. However, if you
                        modify the values of the object variable, the change will not last, demonstrating that it is
                        indeed passed by value.
