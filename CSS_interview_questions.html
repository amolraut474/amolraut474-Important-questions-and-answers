                        determines how the elements/contents in the page are looked/shown. CSS is used to develop a
                        consistent look and feel for all the pages.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>To center an element horizontally, you can set its margin property to auto
                        and specify a width for the element. For vertical centering, you can use the CSS Flexbox layout
                        or the position property along with the top, bottom, left, and right properties to position the
                        element at 50% from the top and then use the transform property with the translateY(-50%) value
                        to center it vertically.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes the layout of
                        HTML elements on a web page. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and
                        margin. The content area contains the actual content of the element, surrounded by padding,
                        which creates space between the content and the border. The border outlines the padding and
                        content, and the margin provides space between the element's border and other elements on the
                        page.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What are CSS selectors, and how do they work?</h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements based on
                        their attributes, IDs, classes, or element types. Selectors target specific elements in an HTML
                        document, allowing developers to apply styles selectively. For example, the element selector
                        targets all instances of a specific HTML element type, the .class selector targets elements with
                        a specific class, and the #id selector targets elements with a specific ID attribute.
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Classes and IDs are both used to apply styles to HTML elements, but they
                        have some key differences. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, allowing for reusable
                        styles across different parts of a web page. IDs, on the other hand, should be unique within a
                        page and are typically used to target a specific element for styling or JavaScript interactions.
                        Additionally, IDs have higher specificity in CSS compared to classes.

                     <h2><span>questions:-</span>What are CSS Grid and Flexbox, and when would you use each?
                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout systems in CSS used for creating complex
                        and responsive layouts.
                        Flexbox: Ideal for arranging items within a single-dimensional layout (either in rows or
                        columns). It's well-suited for aligning items within a container and distributing space among
                        them. Flexbox is great for navigation bars, card layouts, or any UI component where content
                        needs to be dynamically aligned.
                        CSS Grid: Provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, allowing precise control over
                        both rows and columns. It's best used for overall page layout, where elements need to be placed
                        in specific grid areas or have more complex alignment requirements.
                     </p>

                        applications?
                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The "float" property in CSS is used to align elements horizontally within
                        their container. It's commonly used for creating layouts where elements can wrap around each
                        other, like in multi-column designs or floating images within text. However, it's important to
                        note that floats can lead to layout issues, such as clearing floats properly to avoid unintended
                        overlap or misalignment, which may require additional CSS or clearfix techniques to address.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> To create a responsive layout, I would use media queries to apply
                        different styles based on the viewport width. By setting breakpoints and adjusting styles
                        accordingly, I can ensure that the layout adapts smoothly to various screen sizes. Additionally,
                        I would utilize flexible units like percentages, viewport units, or flexbox/grid layout to
                        create fluid and adaptable designs.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span> To center an element horizontally, you can set its margin property to
                        auto and its display property to either block or inline-block. To center an element vertically,
                        you can use the flexbox layout or CSS grid. Alternatively, you can use the transform property
                        with the translate() function.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. They
                        only take up as much width as necessary and do not force line breaks. Examples include span, a,
                        and img. Block-level elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and occupy the full width
                        available. They create a visual block on the page. Examples include div, p, and h1-h6.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Pseudo-classes are keywords that specify a special state of an element.
                        They allow you to style elements based on user interaction or document structure that can't be
                        targeted using ordinary selectors. Examples include :hover, :active, :focus, and :nth-child().
                     </p>

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Block Elements are div and p. They usually start on a new line and can
                        take space for an entire row or width.
                        Inline elements are a, span, strong, and img tags. They don't start on a new line. However, they
                        appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them.
                        Inline block elements have padding and margins and set height and width values. Though, they are
                        similar to inline elements.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>Margin is the space outside the border of an element, while padding is the
                        space between the content of an element and its border. Margin creates space between elements,
                        while padding creates space within an element.

                     <p><span>answers:-</span>A universal selector is a selector that matches any element type's name

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an
                        element. In simple word, you can say that it specifies the clarity of the image. In technical
                        terms, Opacity is defined as the degree to which light is allowed to travel through an object.

                        the non-static parent, i.e., if we write right:20 px, the result will be 20 px far from the
                        right edge of the parent element.

                     </h2>
                     <p><span>answers:-</span>The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an
                        element or an HTML entity. There are five different types of position properties available in
                        CSS:
                        Fixed: Any HTML element with position: fixed property will be positioned relative to the viewport. An element with fixed positioning allows it to remain at the same position even as we scroll the page. We can set the position of the element using the top, right, bottom, and left.
                        Static: This method of positioning is set by default. If we donâ€™t mention the method of positioning for any element, the element has the position: static method by default. By defining Static, the top, right, bottom and left will not have any control over the element. The element will be positioned with the normal flow of the page.
                        Relative: An element with position: relative is positioned relatively with the other elements which are sitting at top of it. If we set its top, right, bottom, or left, other elements will not fill up the gap left by this element.

                        Absolute: An element with position: absolute will be positioned with respect to its parent. The positioning of this element does not depend upon its siblings or the elements which are at the same level.
                        Sticky: Element with position: sticky and top: 0 played a role between fixed & relative based on the position where it is placed. If the element is placed in the middle of the document then when the user scrolls the document, the sticky element starts scrolling until it touches the top. When it touches the top, it will be fixed at that place in spite of further scrolling. We can stick the element at the bottom, with the bottom property.
